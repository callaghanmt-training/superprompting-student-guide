# 6. SuperPrompts for Career Preparation and Job Applications in STEM

Preparing for a career in STEM involves mastering job applications, CVs, cover letters, and interview techniques. Large language models like ChatGPT can be a valuable resource in this process. This one-page guide will demonstrate how to write prompts that assist students in preparing for STEM careers, from crafting an excellent CV to performing well in the job interview.

Remember that most of the training data for the GPT models is for American or International English. This might mean that some of the suggestions you get are a bit americanised and may need a rewrite for your local audience.

## Tips for Crafting Career Preparation and Job Application Prompts

1. **Specify the Job or Field**: Clearly state the job title, field, or industry you are targeting, providing context for the model to tailor its suggestions and advice.

2. **Request CV and Resume Assistance**: Ask the model to help you create, review, or improve your CV, focusing on showcasing your skills, education, and experience relevant to the job you are applying for.

3. **Seek Cover Letter Guidance**: Request help with writing or refining a cover letter, ensuring it effectively conveys your motivation, skills, and suitability for the job.

4. **Inquire about Interview Techniques**: Ask the model for advice on preparing for interviews in the STEM field, including potential questions, effective responses, and general tips.

5. **Encourage Networking**: Request guidance on networking strategies, such as attending conferences, joining professional associations, or leveraging social media platforms.
