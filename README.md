Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have are revolutionising various fields, including teaching and learning in STEM subjects. To fully harness the power of these models, mastering the art of prompt engineering is essential. 

This one-page guide will provide an overview of prompt engineering, its significance in the context of LLMs, and the benefits of developing this skill for employability and academic success.

By developing your prompt engineering skills (very likely to be a key employability skill in the next year), you can enhance your time at University, improve your productivity, and increase your employability in the STEM job market.

Most of you will be using the free version of ChatGPT which uses the GPT3.5 model.  The paid-for version uses the more advanced GPT4 model which provides far more insightful replies.  As with all use of LLMs, they're there to help & support and not to do the work for you.

## What is Prompt Engineering?

**Prompt engineering** is the process of designing effective, context-rich, and purpose-driven prompts to obtain accurate and relevant responses from LLMs. This skill involves understanding the nuances of the model's capabilities and limitations while tailoring prompts to get your desired outcomes.

## Benefits of Prompt Engineering for STEM Students

1. **Enhanced Learning Experience**: Writing effective prompts can help students better engage with complex STEM concepts, deepen their understanding, and strengthen problem-solving skills.

2. **Increased Productivity**: Well-crafted prompts can save time and effort, as LLMs provide more accurate and relevant information, reducing the need for repeated iterations of questioning. You get better results faster, and with far less frustration.

3. **Employability**: As AI becomes increasingly prevalent in the job market, having prompt engineering skills can set you apart from other candidates and increase your employability in STEM careers.

## Tips for Effective Prompt Engineering in STEM

1. **Define the Objective**: Clearly outline the purpose and desired outcomes of the prompt. Consider the specific problem you need to solve or the concept you want to explore.

2. **Be Specific and Contextual**: Provide enough context and information to guide the model's response. Include relevant details, examples, and constraints as necessary.

3. **Clarify the Desired Format**: Explicitly state the format you want the response in, such as a step-by-step solution, bullet points, or a summary. GPT4 can even give you annotated code or even Markdown-formatted text. Just ask.

4. **Manage Response Length**: Specify the length of the response to ensure it is suitable for your intended use.

5. **Request Multiple Perspectives**: To encourage comprehensive exploration, ask for alternative strategies, potential challenges, or suggestions for improvement.

6. **Encourage Sourcing**: Request the model to provide sources, references, or citations to back up its claims.  GPT3.5 will make many of these up so you will need to confirm these with your own research.  GPT4 gets most of the references right but still they will need to be checked so that you are happy the source reflects what you want to assert.

### Example SuperPrompt:

Objective: Understand the process of protein folding.

Prompt: Explain the process of protein folding in eukaryotic cells, including the role of chaperone proteins and the potential consequences of protein misfolding. Provide a step-by-step overview of the folding process and discuss how misfolding can lead to diseases such as Alzheimer's. Include at least two reputable sources to support your explanation. Limit your answer to approximately 300 words.
