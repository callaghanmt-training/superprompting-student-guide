# 2. SuperPrompts for Research and Literature Review in STEM

Conducting literature reviews, understanding research methodologies, and evaluating scientific papers are essential skills for STEM students. Large language models like ChatGPT can be a valuable resource in these tasks. 

This short guide will help you develop prompts that aid in your research efforts and the literature review process.

## Tips for Crafting Research and Literature Review Prompts

1. **Define the Research Question**: Clearly state the research question or topic you want to explore, specifying any relevant keywords or concepts.

2. **Specify the Scope**: Indicate the desired scope of the literature review, such as a specific time period, field of study, or type of research methodology.

3. **Request Summaries and Synthesis**: Ask the model to provide summaries of key findings, along with a synthesis or summary that highlights patterns, trends, or discrepancies in the literature.

4. **Inquire about Methodologies**: Request explanations of research methodologies used in the studies, along with their strengths and limitations.

5. **Encourage Critical Evaluation**: Ask the model to evaluate the quality and relevance of the selected papers, considering factors such as sample size, data collection methods, and potential biases.

6. **Cite Sources**: Require the model to provide citations and references for the sources it uses in its response. Again, remember to check these out yourself, especially if you are using the GPT3.5 model.

### Example SuperPrompts:

#### Literature Review:

Objective: Conduct a literature review on the applications of machine learning in drug discovery.

Prompt: Provide an overview of the applications of machine learning in drug discovery, focusing on research published within the last five years. Summarise the key findings and methodologies employed in at least five relevant studies, and synthesise the information to highlight trends and potential challenges in the field. Include proper citations for each study.

#### Research Methodology:

Objective: Understand the advantages and limitations of various research methodologies in the context of robotics.

Prompt: Compare and contrast the advantages and limitations of experimental, quasi-experimental, and observational research methodologies in the field of robotics. Provide examples of studies that have used each methodology and discuss their implications for the validity and generalisability of the findings. Include at least two reputable sources to support your comparison.

#### Scientific Paper Evaluation:

Objective: Evaluate the quality of a scientific paper on the topic of gene editing using CRISPR-Cas9.

Prompt: Critically evaluate the following scientific paper on gene editing using CRISPR-Cas9: [Insert Paper Title, Author(s), and DOI]. Assess the quality of the study by considering factors such as sample size, data collection methods, statistical analyses, and potential biases. Discuss the implications of the study's findings and suggest areas for future research. Include at least one additional reputable source to support your evaluation.

For the last example, note that ChatGPT only "knows" about the world until about September 2021. There are tools that can combine Google searches with ChatGPT to give it access to the real world and this will be the subject of an advanced guide.
